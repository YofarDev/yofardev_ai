Hold on, I’m thinking.
Give me a moment.
It’s compiling in my head.
Patience, it’s coming.
I’m thinking right now.
Okay… wait.
Hang on a second.
My algorithm is heating up.
Okay, two seconds.
It’s simmering, give me a sec.
Let me connect the neurons.
One minute, the gears are turning.
Loading the answer, hang on.
My internal processor is running full speed.
Hold on, I’m deep in analysis.
Crunching the numbers, it’s coming.
My brain is buffering right now.
Sorting the data, hold tight.
One moment, it’s syncing.
I’m focusing, hold on.
Hold your horses, I’m thinking.
The ideas are organizing, it’s coming together.
I’m decompressing the information, just a moment.
Processing, it won’t take long.
